# CloudBike Website Repo
## Description:
The CloudBike website pulls data from the server that our custom Arduino Tachometer and a Microsoft Band sends data to while the user is biking. The user can start a trip, during which the Android App creates in a JSON to store all of their ride data. The data is then sent to the MongoDB server for processing. From there the data is sent to the website and rendered through various Highcharts graphs and a map created using the Google Maps API.
