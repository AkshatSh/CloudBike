DubHax:

General Notes:
  1. Bluetooth stream to the phone. Communicating to bluetooth to phone. This is the arduino part.
  2. So find a place to mount the arduino/batteries/light sensor strip.
  3. Time estimate: 7-8 worst case scenario.
  4. Meet at 2:30pm Engineering Library.
  5. Akshat and Cedric meet up to discuss web stuff at HUB
  6. Trevor and Robby meet up to get bike geared up after Engineering Library meeting at the Makerspace.

Website Notes:
  1. Hella work, so as soon as Akshat and Robby are done, help Cedric with layout.
  2. Cedric should do before the Hackathon:
	     Find a map that is interactive and can be drawn on if possible.
	     Draw up a basic plan for the website layout
	     Learn how to do Facebook authentication online (login with Facebook)
  3. Robby work on app for android that feeds data to server. (post request to an address).
  4. Akshat sets up a webserver.
  5. Look into recruiting Joseph for Android Dev. and extra help with website.

Bare Minimum:
  1. Basic mount on the bike with light strip.
  2. App has no features, only play and pause button for sending data. Data has to include bike data (speed, rpms) and cell data (gps).
  3. Server analyze the data, store it.
  4. Website: Display the data (no login, no BS, just the map).
As soon as this is done, add hella features.
