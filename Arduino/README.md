## Data Acquisition Cases
1. IR-LED Sensor to Photo Diode on Fork Mount Model.
2. IR-LED Sensor to Photo Diode on Plastic Bag Model.
3. IR-LED Sensor with White Strip on Fork Mount Model.

#### Fork Mount Model
  Using bike-rack supports (which are forks around the wheel). Attach the sensor and the photo diode to opposite supports, create a black strip that runs along the wheel (or buy it at the Bike Shop - Robby). Black strip blocks light to IR, thus creating a count of RPM. Battery and Arduino are stored inside water-proof case (Robby has this) on top of the rack, wires run along fork to the mounts.

#### Plastic Bag Model
  Mount the arduino and batteries onto the main shaft of the bike using electrical tape, zip ties, and hot glue. Plastic bag used to waterproof the circuit. Wires run along brake and gear shafts to the sensor and diode mounts.
  
#### Mounts for sensors/diodes
  Hot glue electrical tape to the mount area to prevent short-circuiting and eddy currents. Zip tie and hot glue sensors to the mounting area. Possibly cover with plastic bags to prevent water damage.
